# Soul-Headphones
This repository is to contain the design and code for wireless headphones as designed by Andrew Lawley.

V1 of this project was originally completed as a personal project as a second year mechanical engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. The aim of the project was to create a pair of wireless headphones using salvaged parts and available breakout boards. V1 was a success but had a series of flaws as discussed in project notes which will also discuss the upgrades and changes to be made in V2.
